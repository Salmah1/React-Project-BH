# React Project


### Description

This project is centered on two categories:

* The first is a charity to which people can donate items.
* The second category consists of a products page where items crafted by people of determination are sold.

To donate items or purchase products from the site, the user must first login and enter their information. The website will then be able to process requests and orders from the exisiting products list. The entire profit earned from the sales will go directly to the charity home.
